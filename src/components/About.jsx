      <p>I’m Roxz Rafil, a third-year Information Technology student with a passion for gaming and adventure. When I’m not immersed in my studies, you can find me leveling up in my favorite games or breaking a sweat at the gym. I thrive on new experiences and love exploring the great outdoors. I’m always eager to learn and develop my skills in tech. I also love a pussy cat.</p>
